### **2️⃣ Authenticate & Get Access Token**

Console.WriteLine($"Access Token: {tokenResponse.AccessToken}");
```

---

### **3️⃣ Create a Payment**
```csharp
var request = new FibCreatePaymentRequest
{
    MonetaryValue = new FibMonetaryValue
    {
        Amount = "1000",
        Currency = "IQD"
    },
    StatusCallbackUrl = "https://webhook-test.com",
    Description = "Tested By Pshitiwan",
    ExpiresIn = "PT5M",
    Category = "POS",
    RefundableFor = "PT48H"
};

var response = await paymentService.CreatePaymentAsync(request);

if (response != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Payment successful! Transaction ID: {response.TransactionId}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Payment failed.");
}
```

---

### **4️⃣ Check Payment Status**

Console.WriteLine($"Payment Status: {statusResponse?.Status}");
```

---

### **5️⃣ Cancel a Payment**
```csharp
await paymentService.CancelPaymentAsync("txn_123456");
Console.WriteLine("Payment cancelled successfully.");

## 🛠 Configuration
You can configure **API Credentials** in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "FibPaymentSDK": {
    "ApiBaseUrl": "https://api.fibpayment.com",
    "ClientId": "your-client-id",
    "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret"
  }
}
```

Or set it dynamically:
```csharp
var paymentService = new FibPaymentService(httpClient, "https://api.fibpayment.com", "your-client-id", "your-client-secret");
```

---

## 🔄 Poll Payment Status
If you need to **continuously check** payment status, use the `PollPaymentStatusAsync` method:
```csharp
await paymentService.PollPaymentStatusAsync("txn_123456", 5, 60, async status =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Payment Status Updated: {status.Status}");
});
```
This will check the payment **every 5 seconds** for up to **60 seconds**.
